Tree-Practice
This repository contains practice problems and solutions related to tree data structures, implemented in Python. It serves as a resource for learning and experimenting with tree-related concepts such as tree traversals, insertions, deletions, and other fundamental operations. The code is designed to help students and developers strengthen their understanding of trees through practical examples.
Contents

tree.py: Contains the implementation of a tree data structure along with basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and various tree traversals (e.g., in-order, pre-order, post-order).
Other Python files may include specific problems or variations on tree implementations, such as binary search trees, AVL trees, or other tree-based algorithms.

How to Use

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/hureramujeeb60/Tree-Practice.git


Navigate to the Directory:
cd Tree-Practice


Run the Python Scripts:Each file can be run individually using Python. For example:
python tree.py

Note: Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher recommended). The scripts assume a standard Python environment with no external dependencies unless specified in individual files.
