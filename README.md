# Tree-Practice

This repository contains practice problems and solutions related to tree data structures, implemented in Python. It serves as a resource for learning and experimenting with tree-related concepts such as tree traversals, insertions, deletions, and other fundamental operations. The code is designed to help students and developers strengthen their understanding of trees through practical examples.

## Contents

- **tree.py**: Contains the implementation of a tree data structure along with basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and various tree traversals (e.g., in-order, pre-order, post-order). Other Python files may include specific problems or variations on tree implementations, such as binary search trees, AVL trees, or other tree-based algorithms.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hureramujeeb60/Tree-Practice.git
